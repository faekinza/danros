    <h2>Dear Danish Rostino, </h2>
    <h2>
      üíå This scrapbook is dedicated to you, my handsome, sweetest, and most loving boyfriend.
Alhamdulillah for every moment we‚Äôve shared, every smile, every test, and every blessing that brought us closer. I believe Allah placed you in my life for a reason, and through every page of this scrapbook, I want you to feel how grateful I am for you.
May He guide, protect, and bless this journey of ours in this dunya and into Jannah, in shaa Allah. ü§ç <br/> <br/>

    <p><b>Our First Date</b></p>
    <p>I still remember that day so vividly. April 2nd, our very first date. We went to that cozy little waffle place, and somehow, 
      feeding you each bite just felt so natural and silly in the best way.
After that, we went to watch the sunset at Kent Ridge Park. <br/> The sky was soft and glowing, and it felt like time slowed down just for us. 
I remember laughing so much that night‚Äîlike, the kind of laughter that makes my face hurt but my heart full.
That night felt like the start of something beautiful. And it was. üíó</p>

    <p><b>Our First Raya Together ‚òæ‚≠ë </b></p>
    
    <p>Just one week after our first date and
      we were already meeting each other‚Äôs parents. 
      But it didn‚Äôt feel rushed. It felt right. 
      Like something we both needed to show how serious 
      we are about each other.

I wasn‚Äôt hesitant at all. Deep down, I just knew this was 
something special. The only thing on my mind was whether 
your family would like me. But Alhamdulillah, everything went 
smoothly. </p>

    <p><b>To my Handsome and Loving Boyfriend,</b></p><br/> 
    <p>
      üíå You‚Äôve brought so much light into my life, more than you probably know. 
From the moment we met, you‚Äôve made me feel seen, cared for, and so genuinely loved. 
Truly, you've made me the happiest.<br/> <br/>

Thank you for being so endlessly patient with me, for putting up with my perangai and my cravings 
without a single complaint. For always showing up, even when I might‚Äôve 
been hard to read or when I pushed you away on days I felt overwhelmed. Thank you for not 
giving up on me. <br/> <br/>

Thank you for always fetching me to and from work, and for every meal, snack, and 
drink you‚Äôve given me. May Allah bless your rizq and reward you for every bite and sip.

Thank you for making me feel deeply loved, for making me laugh on days 
I didn‚Äôt even feel like smiling, and for always being so thoughtful like bringing me 
siew mai and a drink just so I‚Äôd have something for work. And the little things you do 
without ever needing to be asked. It all matters to me.<br/> <br/>

You‚Äôve shown me that chivalry isn‚Äôt dead and that love, when it‚Äôs real, is gentle, 
patient, and strong.
Thank you for choosing me, for choosing to love me as I am, and for loving me unconditionally.<br/> <br/>

I hope to spend the rest of my life in this world and in the hereafter by your side.
And I pray, always, for your happiness, your health, your wealth, and for the beautiful 
future we‚Äôre building together, day by day.<br/> <br/>

With all my love,
Yours always. ü§ç</p>
